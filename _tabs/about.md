# Who Am I?

Hello, I'm **Samuel Laveau**, a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for solving complex problems and securing digital environments. I specialize in **offensive security** and have a particular interest in **penetration testing** and **capture-the-flag (CTF)** challenges.

## 🔐 My Journey

I started my cybersecurity journey as a hobby, but it quickly became a passion. Over time, I developed my skills by tackling CTF challenges, participating in hands-on training platforms like **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box**, and continuously expanding my knowledge through certifications and real-world experience.  

My most recent achievement is earning the **eJPTv2 certification**, demonstrating my proficiency in penetration testing and security practices. I enjoy breaking down complex security topics and writing detailed writeups that help others learn from my experiences.

## ⚙️ Skills

- **Privilege Escalation**: Skilled in performing privilege escalation (privesc) in both **Windows** and **Linux** environments, identifying and exploiting vulnerable configurations and misconfigurations.
- **Exploitation Phase**: Familiar with exploitation techniques for both **Windows** and **Linux**, including remote code execution, buffer overflows, and local privilege escalation exploits.
- **Penetration Testing**: Proficient in the penetration testing lifecycle from **information gathering** to **exploitation** and **post-exploitation** activities. 
- **Web Application Security**: Knowledgeable in common vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, and **CSRF**.
- **Scripting & Automation**: Competent in automating tasks with **Python** and **Bash** to facilitate security testing and exploitation processes.

## 🌱 Current Focus

My current focus is on sharpening my penetration testing skills and contributing to the community through detailed writeups and educational resources. I regularly write about my learnings on [ne4rby.github.io](https://ne4rby.github.io) and contribute to cybersecurity discussions wherever I can.
